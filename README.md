In this repository, I have written a simple API that works in a headless mode to query Google and return it's results in the terminal including titles. Each function does slightly different task. 

1. ```Search Google```: Func to search google and return X number of results
2. ```Search ArXiv```: Func to return arXiv links
3. ```Advanced Search```: Func to return arXiv and X amount of links and the webpage titles
